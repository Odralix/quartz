Also known as LeukóLéon or The White Lion

Rumored to be blessed by both [[Alkéia]] and [[Ágrios]] he is the rightful king of [[Thársos]]

He fought in the 10 year war against the Amazon and is soon to return home successful. Having been one of the most pivotal warriors [[Kaûmena II Tabiti The Lost Princess]] arrives home to Àtopos upon his ship. Before being brought to [[Kýriosagora]].

He is known to be both exremely cunning and a powerful warrior. Strategy and Fury made One. It is said his skin itself cannot be penetrated by any weapon but that such claims cannot be guranteed as he is too quick for anyone to ever have landed a single blow.

To him battle seems but a dance and he dodges weaves and strikes all quicker than mortal eyes can follow.

In personality the king is aware of his position and talent but often appears understanding and merciful even in the presence of the most vile of people. 

Friend of [[Iphled the Infirm]]
