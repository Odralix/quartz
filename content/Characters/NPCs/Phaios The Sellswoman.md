Sells numerous different trinkets and little extras that all essentially do nothing. Unless you persuade her to open her *special*
stock.

Got along well with Plume and the head. Seems to be on good terms with [[Atticus]]

First encountered in the agora of [[Th√°rsos]].

Appears to have a particular interest in feathers and vastly different types of memorabilia as well as "shinies".
