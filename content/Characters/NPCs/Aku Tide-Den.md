### Description

#### Appearance

Aku is a tall, lean but muscular sea elf/water nymph with shark-like features draped in long hanging clothing that gives the illusion of a manta ray upon his back when he spreads his arms wide.

He often steeples his fingers and carries a near constant smirking expression, revealing sharp shark-like rows of teeth.

#### Personality

Quick to adapt to any given situation or role, Aku is a person of many hats and responsibilities. As A leader he is confident, strategic and unimpeachable.  As a diplomat in arguments his opponents often find their footing on the subject significantly more slippery than they first believed. This as Aku's trademark sharp-toothed smirk and sharper wit unnerves most people swiftly.

They're relatively easy-going and always willing to make a deal though any negotiation has a tendency to feel slightly threatening as they always seem to know more about their would be client than they should.

While some are quick to dismiss him as a nefarious crook of some kind due to the his somewhat sleazy demeanour he cares deeply for his friends, allies and the good name of Atlanteans everywhere. And will defend his interests fiercely. 

### Connections

He leads [[The Riptide Retainers]] operating under the [[Atlantean Accords]] which business is threatened by the end of the war.

### Party Interactions

Has requested the help of the party to clear a pirate encampment nearby before the local authorites can get to it.
