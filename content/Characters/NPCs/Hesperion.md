The Wild Warden of [[Thársos]] also known as The Hot Minotaur

Who attempted to save the party from a chimera by jumping off the back of his pet Wyvern only to find it already incapacitated by a certain Pseudodragon.

It falls to him to train new hunters and keep the city safe from the dangerous monsters and wildlife that surround it. Especially if the city's military forces are allocated to war. In times of peace he leads expeditions to the most dangerous parts of the island and spends more time in the field.

He's known as the second strongest man in [[Thársos]] after [[Rex Kharisian]]

He's the younger brother of [[Atreidaes]]
