A wealthy merchant and gorgon from [[Phaedria]] who always has the pulse on the latest "Hot Goss" in [[Hexisos]].

To the degree that it is said that "The fastest way to get word from one end of Átopos to another is not by mail or decree. It is to tell Amarissa and keep it a secret."

Back in the day she was a close friend to [[Tricha II Kerato]] 

>[!kith|friend] **Tricha** _They were the town gossips in the day_
