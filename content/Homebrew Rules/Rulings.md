Fuck Encumberance. 
#### 2. 
Unearthed Arcana options/Homebrew are OKayed or not on a case-by-case basis (These WILL be tuned if they feel terribly unbalanced and are subject to change. That's the risk of them) 
#### 3. 
Multiclass is A-Okay (As long as you meet ASI requirements) 
#### 4. 
Technically Skill Checks cannot be critted. That's Boring so nat 20 is automatic success and nat 1 is an automatic failure. ((Unless a Class Feature or other game mechanic wards you from it such as a rogue's Reliable Talent Feature. Or Halfing's "Lucky"))

**The Deal** Sometimes. A DM wishes to be benevolent. Sometimes you are a +1 off from making an important roll, sometimes the narrative is more interesting if you succeed. Sometimes fate shifts ever so slightly in your favor for a single moment. At some points in the game I might offer you A Deal. A deal will usually be something as simple as giving you a +1 turning a 14 into a 15 and the like. In return. You give ME as the DM an inspiration die that when used will subtract negatively from one of your rolls. You can only make a deal if I do not currently have a nega-insperation against you.

**The Haymaker.** Sometimes an NPC really annoys you. Sometimes another PC needs to be put in their place. Sometimes the monster is SO CLOSE to dying and you just want to give it your ALL. Sometimes your STR modifier is negative. Sometimes you want to punch a wall for emphasis. Enter _The Haymaker_

```
Once per long rest you may use a Bonus Action to Unleash *The Haymaker*. 

The Haymaker is an unarmed attack where you punch, bite, kick or claw, slap or otherwise hurt an opponent. 

If it hits: _No matter what_ it deals 1d4 damage.

No feature or spell will add or subtract any damage from this. 

It will always be 1d4 without bonuses no matter what you do. The _ONLY_ exception is that if a creature is immune to non-magical bludgeoning damage it does nothing.
