I implement limited spell-selection in this campaign to keep things more balanced, keep the game running and be able to hand out more unique or powerful spells when its more fitting. All spells from the following sources are allowed: PHB Xanathars Tashas Fizzban's Theros And all others are not allowed for the time being. Feel free to bring up any individual spells if they feel very fitting. You can easily filter to these requirements [here](https://5e.tools/spells.html#abi-dalzim's%20horrid%20wilting_xge](https://5e.tools/spells.html#abi-dalzim's%20horrid%20wilting_xge "https://5e.tools/spells.html#abi-dalzim's%20horrid%20wilting_xge")
