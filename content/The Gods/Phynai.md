-Goddess of Plants, Trees, Beasts, Nature, the outdoors and The Wild-

Also referred to as Mother Nature she personifies all things wild and free. Including some monsters such as Wyverns, Manticores and Cerberi.

Seen as a neutral goddess but one who's wrath  and favor is unpredictable. Especially among those who have never left a Polis. In fact when a dog or other animal bites its owner unprovoked it is called a "Bite of Phynai". A Bite of the wild.

She is the Matron Goddess of Druids and followed by many. Her followers often insists her whims are not as strange as they may seem. She simply demands a certain amount of respect and many who have not lived in nature is simply unaware of the amount of damage a seemingly innocous act such as breaking branches or moving river rocks may have on the environment.

She is the Mother of [[Ágrios]] and [[Hédonos]]

And paradoxically to some the lifepartner of [[Oikoa]]
