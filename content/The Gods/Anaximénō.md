-The God Who Waits-

Anaximéno is the Lord of the Underworld "[[Apóllumnos]]" and he is often depicted as a faintly smiling older white-bearded gentleman. Often with open arms wearing simple clothing except for the fine blood-red cloak carried upon his back.

While many also portray Anaximéno in a more grim aspect often as a skelletal figure in dark clothing his worshipers insists that the god of death is in fact very fond of the living. Unlike many of the other divines he rarely involves himeself in earthly matters. Simply preferring to wait to recieve the living when their time has come.

Despite his generally gentle demeanor there are a few things that are known to spur him to action though usually in chtonic affairs. Those who attempt escape of the Underworld pose a threat to the living something the god of death will not abide. His clerics and paladins are known to be extremely ruthless and effective in their hunting of undead.

The times when he does interviene with mortals is known to be in situations of wide-spread distaster or conflict affecting many individuals. There are tales of Anaximéno entering these disasters long after they've begun by simply clawing his way out of the ground and putting a definitive end to them. 

For example on the 50th clash of a great war long ago is the terrible tale of "The Swallowing".
Wherein an agressing city's officals refused to end a war despite many prepositions of reasonable terms. Causing a war lasting decades and costing hundreds of thousands of lives.

Eventually it is said that Anaximéno tired of the conflict as an ever-increasing amount of souls entered the after-life. It is said that all light drained from the agressing city and its governmental building was Swallowed by the earth whole. Its leaders thrown directly into [[Apóllumnos]] and judged in the lord who waits own house.

Many followers of Anaximéno consider this heresy and hearsay as there is no record of such a city surviving to current day or even notation of what other cities would be involved in the war.

Perhaps he was more active in ancient times or perhaps his lack of involvment in mortal affairs simply inspires tales by the lack thereof. But one thing is certain. Sooner or later. All mortals will enter his domain.
