Patron of [[Thársos]] 

The god of the hunt, violence and bloodlust is the union of burning desire, cunning patience of a trapper and raw physical strength.

He shares a bitter rivalry with the [[Alkéia]] 

Where as she represents strategy he represents the fighting spirit of a foe that will not give up and continues fighting no matter what and at impossible odds.
