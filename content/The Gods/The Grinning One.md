-or The Nameless One-
-Divine of Joy, friendship, sacrifice, friendly nurturing rivalry, loyalty, curiosity and the spark of genius-

Very little is known of The Nameless One. It is known that they were once mortal and that they via a sacrifice of everything they were saved all life as we know it.

One of the strangest divines of the pantheon as they by all accounts both exist and do not. It is said by their priest that the act of sacrifice itself was on such a fundamental scale that they attained godhood.
