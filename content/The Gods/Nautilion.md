-God of seafaring, water, fishing, hurricanes, waves and rivers, glittering things and sunken treasures-

A triton god of often gentle demanor but unpredictable fury. Like water he can have a calm and steadfast demanor can turn to rapids at the blink of an eye.

Generally seen as a gentle guiding presence to most seafarers his ire can be invoked when at odds with his sister [[Phynai]]. Much like an ocean can roil without becoming a full storm he has a tendency to brood.
