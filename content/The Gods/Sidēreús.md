They are the Patron of [[Pyreus]]

At the Dawn Of Mortals it is said they were responsible for granting all mortal kind abilities to survive better. To many animals they gave fur, wings and claws but once they reached the humanoid races they had ran out of gifts. And so feeling sorry for the furless races they stole Fire from their covetous father (The Titan of Heat) to keep the furless warm.

And so the only Titan in the modern day pantheon the divine of fire solidified thier place in the pantheon.

As a Titan they are the most closely tied in the pantheon to the [[Nymphs]] particularily the [[Fire Nymph]]s and said to have created them from those first mortals that accepted the gift of fire.

As such they are a popular god to worship among Nymphs.
