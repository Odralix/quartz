-Goddess of the Home, indoors, property, Heart, Hearth, Cooking and Domestication-
-Mother of Polis-

Each city has a sacrifical flame which is carried to new colony cities from the mother city. Signifing Oikoa's blessing of the poli.

She is also seen as a protector of mothers and infants and often prayed to during or around childbirth.

She is the protector of the Divine Flame in the abode of the gods and watches over all burnt offerings. There is a version of the myth of [[Sidēreús]] granting fire to Mortals that state him as stealing from this flame instead.

Some insist that if not that Sidēreús must have done something else to earn her scorn as Forges are always kept separate from the Home either outside or in a dedicated workshop.

The relationship between the two is seen as amicable otherwise as they and [[Alkéia]] are often seen as co-operatory for mortal safety and progression.

Strange to some she also shares a close personal partnership with [[Phynai]]
