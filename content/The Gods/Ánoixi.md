-Goddess of Fertility, Spring, Cycles and Princess of the Underworld-
-She of Nightmares and Dreams alike-

A Goddess of two worlds that which grows and that which never will again. Ainixi is the personification of cycles and spring.

It is said she spends half the year underground at the side of her father [[Anaximénō]] and half above ground. Autumn and winter represent her retreat below while spring and summer represents the time of the year she spends above ground.

A common tale these days of how that came to be is the tale of Ánoixi and Anax or "Spring and The King". It was theorized by some that she was the consort of Anaximénō as he otherwise has none but that belief seems to stem from some strange mortal idea of dicotomies and has no historical or mythical rooting.
