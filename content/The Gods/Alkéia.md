Godess of wisdom, fortification, arts, strategy and protection

Patron of [[Sophos]]. She is often depicted in armor but never wearing a helm.

She is the personification of "Logos" logic and strategy. Valuing cunning, battle formations, defensive tactics and the beauty of skilled practiced and polished craftsmanship.

Priests of Alk√©ia urge followers to make decisions with their mind not their heart as emotions are fickle and being ruled by them leads to non-optimal soloutions and lost battles
