-Goddess of passion, persuasion, seduction, love, lust, beauty and procreation-

Paradoxically while she is often seen in a positive light Páxo is also a god of suffering. As in to have such a strong passion or lust for something be it other people or your craft that you suffer to be without it.

She is sometimes compared to [[Hédonos]] as a divine of powerful emotions but her domain centers more around the type of obsessiveness and sometimes helplessness of oneself in the face with strong desires that are not always there willingly.  And as such contrasts with the freedom of mind [[Hédonos]] values.

She is sweet seduction, she is soft and caring and kind. And also jelous and cold and prideful. Hers is the role of love and of disdain.
