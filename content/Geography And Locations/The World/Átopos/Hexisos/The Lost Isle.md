-Home of Monsters-

Once upon a time there were settlements upon this island.
A fortuitous time as it was the largest and carried the most life.

Yet that very life is what should prove its downfall. The lost isle is absolutely chock-FULL of monsters.
Many theorize it may be where they originated in this world.

It is known as a bad omen. A place best left forgotten. Yet many have attempted to kill its monstrous inhabitants and find what treasures may lie within. Stories of those that return are few and far inbetween. Usually only those who stayed by the ships as others entered. They waited for days upon days barely maniging to avoid detection by the wild beasts and monsters within. Until they were forced to leave. Most unable to even describe the visuals of the horrors they've seen.

There are however one or two tales of those who ventured deep within and returned with riches and scars. However those were beyond mortal men. Demi-gods and heroes and in some cases it is rumored. The Gods themselves in disguise. For never do the truly mortal who entered return together with the extraordinary who leave.

Yet every decade a few fools try their luck. And never do they return.
