-City of Trade-

Being the center island in [[Hexisos]] it has become the center of trade in the isles. It also sports particularily fertile soil compared to most other cities despite being on one of the smallest islands.

It is also the main meeting point and center of political movements for the isles. Every island and the larger cities of the mainland have representatives here arguing for trade-agreements, alliances and war-campaigns for Átopos as a whole.

It's main exports are food of grain, fruits, vegetables and livestock. But as the center of trade in the isles most islands make their import purchases here.

And as the locals say "If you can't buy it in Kýriosagora, you can't buy it anywhere"

It is also considered the safest island due to the fact that its small size has allowed the people here to domesticate it in its entirety. There are no native monsters on Kýriosagora!

It is by far the oldest city in the isles, something the ancient [[Great Tower]] in the center of it speaks for as the tallest and oldest building in all of [[Átopos]].
