 -City of The Bold- 

![[Tharsos_Island.jpg]]

Home to a proud warrior-culture and many heroes throughout the ages.
Thársos is a military-focused city-state on the Northern isle of the [[Hexisos]]. It sports many rangers and exotic animal hides and furs which it exports by boat or by wyvern to other city-states. It is also THE place for bloodsports within Átopos. Its grand colosseum is one of its main tourist attractions. If there's two things Thársurians value it's Strength and Honor. As such they are one of the most friendly city-states to races others might percieve as monstrous. To them Cowardice, Poison and lies are far more monstrous than any physical feature would ever be. It is considered the central rival to [[Sophos]]

Their patron god is [[Ágrios]]
