-City of Craftsmen-

Home to the great mountain Pyreus that has become synanymous with the city-state built into the side of it. The mountain itself seems to emenate a strange strong heat and is the origin point of many [[Fire Nymph]]s.

This is the foremost area of metallurgy in the [[Hexisos]] where the finest blades and armors are forged from the bronze and steel mined within the mountain. They mainly export such craft along with unique luxury foods that seem to thrive with the mountains heat. Some merchants are even so bold as to boast that Pyrorian fruits are the same as [[Ambrosia]] the foodstuffs of the gods. This however is considered heresy by some and tall tales by others though you cannot deny fruits and crops from Pyroros have a somewhat fuller, richer and often sweeter taste than most other places in the isles.
