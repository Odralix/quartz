-The City That Shines-

This city is one of the most beautiful places in the isles due to their keen understanding of glasswork and the polishing of gems. Some of which originate here and some of which are processed from raw material sent from [[Pyreus]]

More than half of the island itself is covered in a vast desert wasteland where survival is next to impossible for most races. However the western bank of the island is significantly more humid and hospitable. The drier climate of the island also allows the harvesting of sugarcane and thus also the production of Papyrus a fine and expensive paper used only for the most important of offical documents or paper to be used for spellwork.

The entire city seems to shine in the sunlight which seems more common here than on any other island due to the little pieces of glaswork that seem to adorn every building and every window.

Phaedria is also well known for one particular feature. A few leauges out from the city is a small temple dedicated to [[The Fates]] and inhibited by their chosen champion an Oracle and diviner of outstanding accuracy. Many travel here to ask advice in everything from high-stakes political affairs to love troubles. But a warning sits inscribed on the temple arch. 

"Fate is not kind. Nor is it simple. It is a fickle thing. 
To those who seek tame or know it take heed:
Knowing Fate costs more than most are willing to bleed."
