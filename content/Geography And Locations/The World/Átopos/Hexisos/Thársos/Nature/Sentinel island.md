A small island off the western coast of Thársos.
Within which a cadré of pirates currently appear to be hiding.

Its eastern shore consists of dunes of sand and appears cursed and filled with very old undead skeletons of various types and sizes all seemingly suffering from various forms of frost-magic damage.
