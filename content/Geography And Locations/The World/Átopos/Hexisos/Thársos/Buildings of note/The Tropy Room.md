One of the largest Inns in [[Thársos]] and the HQ of [[The Lion's Share]].

It's essentially a long-house of a building with long tables and the heads, skulls bones teeth and claws of many dangerous animals the guild has taken down decorate the halls. Long slithering Cetus, Wyvern skulls. And even one central head ornament of what is rumored to have been a dragon's skull. Hung there by the original founder.
