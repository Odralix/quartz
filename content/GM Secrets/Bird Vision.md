Plume.

The ship is careening at a furious speed towards the Tharsos dock, wind is whipping at your feathers and the fresh salt-water air does next to nothing to quell your panic at the oncoming collission.

You feverishly tear at the ship's wheel putting all your meager weight into it. Your can feel the wooden handles chip and splinter as they tear out of your claws as it continues its rapid spin.

You can almost see the crash already. That familiar sense of a dreamy haze. Flashes creeping into the back of your mind with horrifying detail. Ships big and small known and unknown to you numbering in the hundreds smashing upon reef, treacherous cliffs, cities and sometimes ships. Their hulls RIPPED asunder by the tremendous force, hundreds of men ripped to shreds or thrown into the water. You can SEE THEIR BON-

*THUNK*

A hand the size of your head *SLAMS* Down on the ship's wheel. Stopping it in its tracks.

A huge. Hulking man, nearly 3 times your height. Looks down at you. Durin's beard is whipping in the wind. His clothing riddled with tears from near-missed missiles. Blood and sweat both dripping off his forehead.

Yet his eyes show only concern.
"Plume. Are you alr-"

Three heavy thuds hit the deck. One particularily heavy and two wet and sloppy. As bodies hit the deck. As one of them rises impossibly tall.

"DURIN!! THE ANCHOR!!" Hesperion roars his massive frame already rushing towards it. Durin wastes no time moving his hide.

-No better way to protect than to make sure the ship doesn't crack apart.-

The two Titanic bodies quickly throw the anchor to sea. 

The ship is finally stopping. You have just enough margin. It looks like you made it just in time.

So why does the air in your lungs still feel so thick. Why is the pressure around you building so heavy. 

*shu-DUNk* A slam from below decks as something heavy is slammed against the ground. 
______
((You hear the viscious clanking of metal as Ko√≠lo is all but Sundered below decks.))
_____

Why does your heart beat so hard in your chest.

*du-dunk*

Why is everything so LOUD?

*du-dunk*

Your eyes are darting around as you lick your beak nervously. But somehow it is as if time itself has slowed. Your eyes moving at a glaciers pace towards the opening from the lower decks where a figure stands on deck.

A large figure. Dressed in armor that seems to reflect not a single fleck of the abundant moonlight. More shadow than person.

They're raising a hand, pointing at you as a translucent spear of pale yellow with some kind of jasper orb under the spear head floats up above their head in an arching motion. Almost akin to a halo.

It backlights their one clearly visible feature. The bone-white fox-like gladiator helm. The darkness within it admitting no hint as to their identity.

Why are they so familiar?

**Laughter.** around your head. In the back of your mind. Small black giggling foxes spinning about your head.

What you don't see. Is what happens next.
A blur of fur, scales and muscle as Hesperion's wyvern wrenches both its master and the figure from the ship in the blink of an eye.

You do not see them shrink to a pin-prick in the sky.

You see only darkness.

Then a light. Two. Four.

Millions. Billions of little lights.

Stars. Enough to illuminate clouds of multi-colored space dust in the vast, vast expanse of the multiverse in front of you. As you hang, weightless and somber in place.

And... something else.

A presence. A warmth. Familiar. Motherly. Worried.

A small cluster of stars seem to burn brighter suddenly and draw closer. Some but not all of them tinting bluish as thin bright blue lines seem to form between them.

They arrange into what you realise are words.

"We don't have much time."

---

Durin. As the dark figure atop the deck begins to point at Plume you attempt to throw yourself between them at the last moment. 

One moment you are in the air staring down this stranger. The next it all goes black.

Then white.
