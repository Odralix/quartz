A black obelisk stands tall silluetted against the sky and sands. Bands of rough-hewn runes glow faintly in red, green and blue.

To all decendants or strangers whom might tread upon this land. This stone is a message and part of a system of messages. It is crucial that you pay attention to it.

Leaving it here for you was important to us. We considered ourselves a powerful culture.

We recommend for your safety that you leave this land. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. There is. Great. Danger.

The danger is still present in your time as it was in ours. This place is best left shunned and uninhabited.

This is a record of the events which shook the land upon which you now stand.

This area below the two mountains was called  Apos púlē (pie-lee). It was once our ancestral burial ground since untold generations. For All our tribes united.

Our relationship to the underworld was always a benign one. We respect the natural cycle of things.

All changed when The Aurora of Annihalation decended upon our people with untold fury. Without a hint of the mercy and nobility of which our matriarch had once been known for.

Thousands were buried here. And we sought to make our last stand. So much death. So many souls at once. Some unable to rest. Opens pathways. Ones we did not realise were there.

In desperation our shamans sought to use it. No weapon or spell of ours was able to pierce the Aurora's scaly hide. But even Kheîma-Crya is not immune to death itself.

AOT bit

Everything that [you](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Survey_Corps "Survey Corps") thought had meaning: every hope, dream, or moment of happiness. None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield. None of it changes what the Annihalations ice-breath does to a body, we all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?... **They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them! And as we rush to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!**

They were slaughtered. Every last one of them here, stood upon countless generations of dead. But their sacrifice was not in vain. We... I. Was able to complete the spell due to the time those brave souls bought us. And deliver a devestating blow. For the first time in as long as anyone can remember that blasted winged beast haunts us no longer.

It's been decades now. Peace. Yet.

The mountains of the mainland lay thick with ice year-round. And I fear it a sign... The beast may still lay resting, recovering. Disturb not its slumber for all the world's sake. Nor that of its bretheren elsewhere. Let Those Who Rest Beneath lay where they lie.

And this place... Our actions... They left... Scars. On us and the land. Younglings die half the age they used to live. Somewhere below these two mountains is a wound. A chasm that still lies open.

Future generations. Heed my warning. Leave this cursed place. Do not. Displease the lord of death. Do Not repeat our mistakes. Stay far. Far away from the underworld. Do not attempt to draw its power. Do not disturb the wound. Do not live nor die here.

Leave. I beg of you. Let this obelisk and the bones lie. Lest she awakens and becomes the monument to all your sins. The way she was to mine.
